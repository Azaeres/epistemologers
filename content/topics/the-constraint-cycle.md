‚Ä™Problems are inevitable, and can be overwhelming even with a good strategy, but so far the best I‚Äôve found is what I call the _Constraint Cycle_.

It‚Äôs a problem-detection pipeline for ideas that can make it all the way ‚Äúfrom concept to market‚Äù.

That pipeline is a series of four types of constraints. Any time we come up with, or come across an idea, we can enter it into this gauntlet of obstacles.

1. **Reason.** This is about rigorously examining the idea for logical conflicts. Critical thinking applies here. Its corresponding philosophy is logic.

2. **Science.** This is about testing the idea as an explanation of the world, or some part of the world. It inherits concerns from 1. Reason, and introduces tests for ideas about how things actually are. Its corresponding philosophy is metaphysics.

3. **Engineering.** This is about intentionally shaping the world. It inherits concerns from 2. Science, and introduces rules for what should be done. Its corresponding philosophy is ethics.

4. **Art.** This is about shaping experiences. It inherits concerns from 3. Engineering to work with some medium, and introduces the intent to convey impressions. Its corresponding philosophy is aesthetics.

If an idea makes it through all these layers of constraint, it 1. Is logically coherent, 2. Is factual, 3. Is an effective recipe to develop our world, and 4. Is effective for inspiring oneself and others.

That inspiration can then yield new ideas that can be entered into the pipe.

Not all ideas meet all these criteria, but this works as a loose guide for both developing factual information, and for using that information to shape our world for the better.
