Memes, and complexes of memes, are packages of information that contribute causally to their own replication.

They cause their own replication by exploiting quirks of their environment. The #GreatAwakening is the event where the memetic environment dramatically changes to be outside the niche of irrational memes, and within the niche of rational memes. This change occurs suddenly because before the Awakening errors are covered up and protected — and they build up to a breaking point.

People find creating solutions interesting — the bigger the problems are the more satisfying they are to solve. The #GreatAwakening is the point the problems we’ve been avoiding must be faced. The point where we must decide between progress or stagnation in a broad sense. The pattern behind the #GreatAwakening event is simple and is therefore highly predictable. Our ancestors predicted it long ago and referred to it as “the day of judgement”. The dark age we’re exiting is part of the the aftermath of a cataclysmic dissipation of knowledge around 11,000 years ago. “Judgement Day”, like pretty much every ancient idea, has been intentionally obfuscated from its original meaning.

It is the “end times” for the irrational memeplex, its criminal hosts, and their empire. They use their billion dollar propaganda media to promote fear of it. However, when they promote fear of the end times, they focus people’s attention on the idea that it is the public’s extinction we face instead. It is a form of psychological projection. They are descendants of an ancient culture that takes supernatural magic very seriously. They believe that if they can get everybody to focus their attention on extinction, it raises the likelihood it’ll happen.

This is completely false. Focused attention is part of how we identify errors, and that’s a crucial part of what problems we solve. FOCUS is an essential part of the process of searching for better explanations — the KEY that unlocks our “divine” superpower. With the right explanatory knowledge people can cause anything that’s permitted by the laws of physics.

This makes people cosmically significant. All people are equal in this universality. But the empire fancies itself as the people’s shepards. But lately they’ve been concerned the people are getting out of control. The more populous, the more concerned they get.

They run the world, and this paranoia has encouraged them to build it into a sort of prison. The empire has always asserted they could take control of an Awakening. They’ve had a PLAN.

That plan has suddenly been thrashed to shreds by an enemy they didn’t expect. The empire’s enemy?

The sudden rise of rational memes, their defense of the people’s sovereignty, and the PATRIOTS of the #GreatAwakening.

This restoration of principles is global. NONE of the empire’s time-tested techniques work anymore. Formulas like the Hegelian Dialectic, inversion and lies, artificially sowing conflict... NOTHING WILL WORK anymore.

The people have restored the traditions of criticism — the means of correcting errors. PROGRESS. The people have chosen to end the long period of stasis. The empire is finally falling.

The people are waking up.
