The law of inevitable error.

No source of information is exempt. So instead of trusting sources, we want to evaluate them for good explanations. Good explanations are recognized by being "hard to vary". It's difficult to change a well-constrained theory because all parts serve a functional role. If we change even a small detail, it tends to BREAK it.

**This is how we tell.**

The most valuable side-effect to having a good explanation, is that they tend to contain much TRUTH. Explanations carry truth. There is no other way to UNDERSTAND what's true, as explanations impart understanding, and truth isn't self-explanatory.

Unfortunately, most people go about finding truth by trying to feel something is justified instead. This confuses the search right out of the gate. There is a big difference between feeling confident and having truth. Seeking justification (actually just the feeling of certainty) only leads to infinite regression until we give up and just believe whatever we want. This is the exact opposite of searching for truth. 

But the truth CAN be acquired in a different way -- through the search for better explanations.

This is a crucially important fact that deserves repeating and retweeting until the world is familiar.
