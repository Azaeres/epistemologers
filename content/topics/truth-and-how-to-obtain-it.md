All information is embodied in the physical properties of some substrate. That substrate can be material (like ink on paper, etc), forming a layer within which abstract objects can be instantiated. That substrate can also be another layer of abstraction.

Abstractions are REAL. Computers are built atop layers and layers of abstractions — where abstractions are not merely the patterns that emerge out of executing tasks, but are components to build higher-level layers of abstraction.

The study of abstraction, and necessary truth, is mathematics. We use abstraction to simulate or model things, and our success at doing so proves we understood those things.

The study of proof is computer science. I mention all this for anyone interested in TRUTH.

Anything that exists can be modeled (albeit only approximately). If a model is an accurate representation of the intended subject, it contains truth. It is ALSO necessarily crude because it is always an approximation. This means that we can use the same cognitive tools that software developers have built in order to acquire TRUTH.

The key to acquiring truth is found in how all models contain bad parts, even if they’re designed to contain good parts. To acquire TRUTH we must logically trace our model in search of conflicts — the parts that are bad approximations — and then solve them.

Knowledge is the information difference between solving a problem and failing to solve it. Knowledge builds up in our solutions to problems. An explanation is an assertion about what’s out there and how it behaves. It’s a kind of model that’s designed to impart understanding. That is, an explanation helps to form in brains the same mathematical relationships that are in the explanation itself. Explanations connect dots, interpret data and evidence, account for an infinity of facts, set expectations and priorities, and guide our focus on what’s meaningful and interesting.

These associations form a web of interconnecting rules and constraints. All true explanations connect with each other in some way. That is, they CONSTRAIN each other (not the same as “support”). It turns out that the better constrained an explanation is, against the evidence and how well it served its purpose, the better it is. And since being well-constrained is a detectable property of explanations, we can recognize when explanations are good. We can expect our best explanations to tell us something deeply true about the world, even as we continue to search for what they get wrong. We can expect that the subjects of good explanations are REAL, and all subjects that are omitted are not real.

We come to understand REALITY by continuously searching for better explanations. This criterion of reality applies to UNSEEN or abstract features of good explanation. Often we must explain what we see in terms of things we don’t see. The search for better explanation is one means of correcting errors — a system that is crucially important to build and protect.

All systems are vulnerable. They can be made; they can be broken; their vulnerabilities can be exploited. We must safeguard the systems that build explanatory knowledge — at pretty much any cost! Failure to do so cripples our ability to adapt to changes or solve the problems that arise. That failure is serious stagnation — essentially synonymous with death. Understanding the way these knowledge-building systems work is necessary to understand how to protect them — to know where they’re breaking down, and what to do to fix them. These systems have many properties — some of which are counterintuitive.

For example, for it to work we must boldly risk trying designs that may be bad. We must develop ways to navigate the bazaar of ideas. We must permit alogical sources of ideas to seed designs. And so on. For everyone interested in acquiring TRUTH, study these ideas! Be critical of them; become familiar with them.

These key ideas (and the many related concepts) will be a welcome guide through the chaos of the #GreatAwakening.
