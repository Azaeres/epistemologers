The global order is an instance of the "cult template", composed out of nested instances. At the bottom, the part where most of us experience it, line's of control are dominated by "thought guidance" (eg. the media) and pos/neg coercion (eg. a salary, or punitive threats). At the top, there's many more examples of direct coercion, esp. threats of harm to self, family, or friends. The higher one goes, the more locked-in one becomes. The cult template puts tremendous pressure on its subjects to conform to its agenda — which is primarily focused on "order", its term for near-complete stasis. This is predicated on a powerful pessimism about human nature. It projects its elitist ideology in the form of sowing interpersonal conflict. They use this conflict to fire people up and then misinforms them about what the problem is. If people aren't careful, they'll be tricked into fighting the wrong fight. This is the social structure of empire. It's existed for thousands of years, and it hasn't gone away. We've just not received a lesson on how it works — and that's by design. Empire is constantly fighting a secret war against YOU. The legacy media is THEIRS. They own it. They use it to help guide YOUR thoughts. And because they are at war with you, they purposefully weaponize your own ideas against you.

Since they're YOUR ideas, you feel ownership of them. You don't see the threat. This is by design. To defend yourself against this, broadly study two topics:

1. Good explanation: what makes them good, and how to recognize them.
2. Progress: what it is, and how to differentiate it from stagnation. The empire tries to sell stagnation to you. They'll use every trick except for true explanation. They'll employ every fallacy and trap they know of. And they're pros.

They've owned this world, and everything in it, for a long time — and they're not playing around. This empire is responsible for The Pattern — the trend for their agenda to surface all over the place. It is a major contributing factor to the swarming complex of irrational memes we experience every day. They want CONTROL — a zero-sum game stacked against you. Their reach is near ubiquitous. They've fabricated an entire world view for you — a view that gives you a lens that conveniently strips them out of the picture. It's the illusory nature of theory — an explanation TRICKS you into understanding the world in a particular way. But GOOD explanations aren't provided. Good explanations are the kind that tricks you into understanding how the world actually is.

Bad explanations are due to ignorance — but the lens they've provided diminishes the role of malicious intent to foment that ignorance. With the lens they've provided, we see a hundred sources of information, and expect some smallish fraction of them to be malicious. This is by design. They don't want you to see the actual ratio. They want every eyeball on someone they can control. Take back control of your thought process first. Train your brain to recognize good explanations from bad — and to look for them instead of "trustworthy" sources of information.

The more progress you make, the closer you get to their wall. They don't want you at the frontier. The more familiar you get with their wall, the easier it gets to see the veil. You'll see otherwise rational people break down into lunatics. You'll see cheating and stealing — all a social effect of the pressures of empire. "Waking up" is really just the adoption of a new world view — one that explains how the world really works, and helps us navigate through it.

Once we've sloughed off their irrational memeplex, we abandon the pessimism that came with it. The world IS waking up — and with that comes new challenges, and new opportunities we GET to take advantage of. This world is owned by its people.

Reclaim it!
