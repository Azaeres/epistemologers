Why does so much of the music industry promote Satanic tropes?

The “beast” idea promotes the nonperson side of humans. That side is necessarily bounded — whereas the part of humans that is a person can rise above it and out of their control.

Stagnation.

Those ideas are old. The empire likes them because of the imperial legacy behind them. Their worldview comes from the Cult of Babylon. I’ll occasionally refer to the old ideas, but only in context. They’ve got a lot of confusing baggage attached. Satanism is a complex of memes — one that’s survived a long time, which means they cause some people to share them.

For regular folks the biggest sources for these ideas are in entertainment. That is, it’s a part of how money’s been moving. The Pattern. Another complex of memes is Luciferianism. This focuses on themes of “rising up”, challenging authority, vengeance, bringing “light”, and establishing new empire.

Lucifer is called the “lightbringer”. Luciferianism is a way to release and capture the energy of fighting back, and use it to safeguard empire.

We’re currently in the midst of wading through many different operations on this theme. As long as empire survives the bringing of light, it was merely a sacrifice — not actually true light. True light will break the cycle of revolution, and establish rapid progress from here on out. Light, in this context, is just knowledge, understanding, truth. The old empire has always held it close, and used it tactfully — like lighting controlled brush fires to burn away anything that might fuel an out-of-control fire. Fire, in this context, is the light of knowledge used as a weapon.

Prometheus is said to be an analog for Lucifer because he “stole fire from heaven to give to man”. The empire has ritualized this story with the lighting of the Olympic Torch. Stadium games and professional sports serve the same role for the empire that it did back in the days of Rome — to capture the people’s attention, emotion, and energy for something unproductive. The empire doesn’t care about making money — it cares about capturing attention.

But money flows where attention goes. Their broader goal is stagnation. To capture attention and dissipate the energy.

As the Awakening proceeds, they’ll continue to try to capture attention even as their businesses go bankrupt — revealing The Pattern once again. The Pattern is the evidence of the empire, its goals and strategies. The empire itself is known through the theory that explains The Pattern. In the empire’s world, everyone has a master — someone that owns them. At the top they’re steamrolled by a phenomenon completely outside their control — an phenomenon that emerges out of the social fabric they’ve built. This entity is what they worship as a god. Their whole complex of irrational, stagnation memes is facing extinction. The memetic environment has completely changed. People are finally criticizing the old memes en masse — immolating them.

The final sacrifice. There won’t be another empire after this.
