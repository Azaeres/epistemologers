The Great Awakening is poised to dwarf the Western Enlightenment as what David Deutsch calls “a beginning of infinity”.[^1]

In a nutshell, the Enlightenment was a rebellion that replaced the epistemic authority of the Church with the authority of sensory experience.

While this step _was_ an improvement, its conclusion was _false_. Knowledge authorities don’t exist, and there is no reliable way to justify ideas as being true or probable.

With the ongoing Great Awakening, we have an opportunity for widespread recognition of this, and to finally establish open source knowledge-building — an example of what Deutsch calls “a tradition of criticism”.

We’re in the process of decentralizing the media, the practice of science, and the search for good explanations.

My expectation is that this decentralization _will_ set up the conditions for the explosive growth of knowledge. Like nothing we’ve ever seen before.

I don’t think the trend toward global nationalization is an accident. I think the way the world works is being fundamentally changed — to pave the way for this decentralization. And I think the new guard understands this.

On top of the boost in the rate of knowledge-building, we’re about to see previously secret knowledge to be made more widely accessible. This “throttling-up”, coupled with the initial “springboard”, will affect our future in unprecedented, profound ways.

This ramp-up might feel overwhelming. Mainstream philosophy leaves us unprepared for what’s about to happen. But I’m optimistic: each problem we’ll encounter is solvable with the right knowledge — especially if our knowledge-building rate is _rapid_.

In fact, the more rapid the rate of knowledge-building, the _more_ unpredictable the future becomes. And all the while we become _more_ capable of keeping up with the pace of problems that arise.
