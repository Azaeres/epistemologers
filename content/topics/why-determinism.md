In abstraction theory, logic consists of those elementary building blocks we can model any mathematical relationship with. This is thanks to the law of the universality of computation — the same law that prohibits the supernatural.

Functions are the logical building block that lets us delegate the details of performing some task. They encapsulate a unit transformation from ‘input to output’.

Deterministic functions, in proof theory, always produce the same output for a given input. This means they cannot be a function of their history; their output is purely a function of their input.

If a function‘s history IS a factor when determining its result, it’s said to be “stateful”. State is variation over time. State, especially state that’s shared between different parts of the model, is notoriously difficult to understand.

‪If we build a software model out of deterministic units, the temporal component is “abstracted away” and becomes of no concern. It becomes more comprehensible — and that’s a serious advantage. The more inherently complex a system is, the more comprehensible we want to build it.

‪The philosophy of preferring to build deterministic models is known as “determinism”. It is a constraint that yields more comprehensible models than stateful or probabilistic counterparts.

Quantum mechanics, when modeled deterministically, is what’s known as the “multiverse” model (or “Many Worlds”).

The main difference that sets the deterministic model apart from probabilistic models is that all outcomes that obey the laws of physics actually happen in parallel timelines.

These timelines are “causally autonomous regions” of the universe that roughly act like the observable universe of classical theory. There’s still one universe’s worth of energy, matter, and information — it just has many parallel causal configurations.

The reason classical theory thought the outcome was probabilistic was because the observer gets tangled up with the causal structure of only one outcome per timeline.

The deterministic view, by virtue of how it clarifies things, shows how probability emerges from a more fundamental, static structure. This also explains why there are no perfectly random processes to be found anywhere. They don’t exist.

This of course runs contrary to common sense, since our experience is always set inside a causal structure that cannot be informed of alternate, parallel timelines. But common sense isn’t always our best judge. Our best explanations are.
