All our deepest understanding of how the world actually is comes from theory, so theory is crucial. Good theory is constrained by evidence, facts, and other good theories — the existence of bad theory doesn’t make all theory bad.

**Conspiracy is war strategy.**

Being a “theorist”, in popular usage, is considered bad — not grounded in reality. But good theory is necessarily constrained by what’s real, because it’s built to account for real events. 

Being a “realist”, in popular usage, is considered good — rational, level-headed. But realism is actually the idea that an objective reality exists. This idea is necessarily theoretical — but it’s the good kind of theory. Something is “real” when it features in a good theory — so we only recognize what’s real through the lens of theory.

Another property of theory is that it is necessarily conjectural — that is, it’s always a guess. This is a fact that justifiers don’t like to face. But it cannot be helped — seeking justification only leads to infinite regression.

In other words, the idea that we acquire knowledge by justifying ideas violates the law of error inevitability. *There’s no reliable means of justifying ideas as being true or probable.*

But the law of error inevitability implies that we have boundless opportunities to correct them and that means PROGRESS is unbounded. Moreover, there is no physical limit to the RATE of progress. People can cause ANYTHING that’s permitted by the laws of physics, given the right knowledge. And the laws of physics permit us to build knowledge for ANY kind of solution. 

**When this optimism drives us, our future is bright!**
