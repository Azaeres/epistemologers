#### Laws and Models of Them

I use the terms “laws of physics” a lot because it’s a kind of grounding constraint. A task is either physically possible, or it’s physically impossible. There’s nothing in between!

Ideas (such as those about tasks) aren’t “likely” or “unlikely” — they’re either correct or incorrect, and we must suppose each to think through the implications of each. Moreover, ideas that model things are necessarily approximate. This is the law of error inevitability, as demonstrated by Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem.

Ideas always have an impurity to them — so our approach to working with them must be about identifying and correcting errors. “Laws of physics” are objectively real regularities in nature. It is physically possible to model them. This is thanks to the law of universality of computation.

#### Computation and Physically Possible Tasks

Computers are systems that use the properties of some substrate to work with information. The tasks of transcribing info from the properties of one system to the properties of another is called encoding/decoding (depending on the direction of transcription). The fact it is physically possible to model the same mathematical relationships in all kinds of systems — from different personal computers, to brains, to scientific experiments, etc. — is also thanks to the law of computational universality. Personal computers are designed to be universal simulators. They can simulate or model whatever we want because they provide logical building blocks developers can use to compose any kind of abstraction. 

In order to develop any software, a developer must first build an explanation for how it’ll work. They MUST model it in their heads before they can model it in software. This is a powerful constraining factor that is the main subject of PROOF.

“Compilation” is a task that transforms a given code into another code, while generally retaining the same mathematical relationships. For example, developers sometimes want to turn a programming language designed to be easily read/written by humans, to a language easily read by machines. The task of building software to build software is called “metaprogramming”. Software like this can be built to create new tasks for itself to run — which can include new tasks to build more tasks.

#### Metaprogramming

This kind of self-development is what life does to build itself new adaptations. Life on Earth is a kind of computer that works with genetic information. Its problems are “niches”, which are always arising — and genetic life diligently builds itself adaptations to that. Its genome contains tons of this info it had inherited from its ancestors. But a “niche” is only a particular kind of problem. Problems in general are logical conflicts — something genetic life wasn’t set up to address — until it built brains.

Brains centralize info processing so that patterns can be recognized, events can be handled, and more. Brains are built to optimize information processing — so the development of information in the form of memes can be much faster than the development of genes. And in the case of PEOPLE, brains are set up to be universal solution creators, capable of explaining solutions for any problem.

This requires metaprogramming, so any simulation of a person (such as AGI) will need to program itself. What people can do was described as “magic” by our predecessors. They have a “divine” power not outdone by anything else in the universe. Cosmic forces are their playthings; not the other way round. People’s sovereignty is of moral significance — all are equal in their universality. A person must be allowed to develop themselves, without being “programmed”.

#### Progress as Seen Through Christian Terminology

This stems from the moral prerogative to not disrupt the means to correct errors. Interference in the means of correcting errors has been done many times throughout history — often in the name of doing what’s right.

But it all cases it is a mistaken sense of righteousness — and a grave evil. Progress CAN be made, it CAN be rapid enough to outpace this evil, and it WILL be if people choose it.

Christians call this optimism the “Holy Spirit”.

“Holy” means “holistic” — of the whole. Universal and objective. And Christians call the day that rational memes outpace irrational memes “Judgement Day” — when people MUST choose progress or be destroyed by stagnating so badly we fail to solve our biggest problems in time. Right now some of the largest problems we face is CORRUPTION — a “deep state” or unelected government that has amassed an out-of-control overreach over global affairs.

It is hell-bent on stifling any innovation that might challenge its rule. People on Earth must now make a decision because we cannot develop and release powerful technology that will transform the world for the better without it falling into corrupt hands.

Solving this means fixing our justice system. The enemies of civilization use people’s own power against them. They invert and confuse ideas to keep people in a cognitive stasis.

#### The Imperial Cult and the Great Awakening

It’s gotten so bad nearly everything they push is completely misleading. The enemies of civilization have ancestral roots with ancient Babylon. Long ago they corrupted the belief systems that eventually grew to become world religions.

Every religion faces its own version of this corruption — and its been an exhausting fight over many centuries. The Cult of Babylon worships stagnation through many different symbols and traditions.

This includes the sun cycle — inverted to represent endless churn. And it includes sacrifice. This Cult speaks publicly to its members through open symbolism — symbolism that will be its downfall as the public picks up the decoding rules.

> Recall that “holocaust” means “burnt sacrifice”. It was always the [Cult].

For its secret practices and beliefs are indefensible in the light of public scrutiny. As the curtain is drawn on these Wizards of Oz, they’re revealed to be pitiful, dangerously misled misfits. They can’t or won’t allow civilization to blossom — they’re stunting our development. It’s time to bring their era to a close. As it turns out, this is already happening. [Watch CEO resignations](https://www.resignation.info/). Watch the world rise up in revolution. Watch the criminality get exposed, leaked, and ultimately brought to justice.

Watch the world wake up.

**And expect great things. Our time has just begun.**
