From easiest to defend to hardest to defend.
## 1. Government is good.

I define Government here as a social system that enforces the norms and rules of a society.

No matter who you are, whether you want more or less, we can't deny that having a system that exists outside of our economic system is good.  
A pure capitalist or any anarchic system would leave us with many problems, how would our roads be maintained? How can we effectively defend ourselves without a military?
Without direction would we really be able to secure the resources required to effectively feed the country?
How can we effectively manage crime and nefarious actors without an external, social system?

I think that anyone seriously considering the consequences of an anarchic government including nefarious actors and people who simply won't play by the 'rules' must agree that
we must have some form of governance and some way of keeping a social order.

## 2. Capitalism is good.

I define capitalism here as the ability to own private property, and produce whatever you wish with it.

Again, this should be relatively simple to agree with.  Captalism is one of the newest innovations of society, and with it came marked advancements in social welfare. 
It gave people the ability to own their own land and property, and decide for themselves how best to use it.  The concepts of capitalism are so powerful it's even preported enemies
have to utilize it to compete. 

## 3. Beuracracy is to be avoided as much as possible

## 4. America is worth defending

## 5. The Government must have a monopoly on violence inside of it's state

## 6. American must remain the superpower
and only relinquish it's spot if there is an heir that champions it's values
